# Height map to OBJ
Heightmap to OBJ is a Java-based tool that can be used to make an untextured 3D model in OBJ format from only a square greyscale image. The code in this repository can be compiled to a runnable JAR file.
Due to limitations in the OBJ format, inputs should be limited to a maximum of 239 by 239 pixels, else there will be too many vertecies.
